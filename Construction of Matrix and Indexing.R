I am constructing a matrix and it has a range of values from 10 to 29. It has 5 columns and 4 rows. Then we do indexing and print first and second row.
 
 
 # Constructing a matrix of 4 rows and 5 columns
 usman<-matrix(10:29,nrow=4,ncol=5)
 #checking the values in a matrix form
 usman
 #indexing is being done from row 1 to row 2.
 usman [1:2,]
