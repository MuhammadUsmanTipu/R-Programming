# R-Programming

1) Constructing a numeric vector and showing how to index every other element of that vector.
2) Construction of a matrix and indexing the first and second row.
3) Finding the indices of all elements in a matrix which is equal to a specific number x.
4) Construction of a list containing a mixture of elements of different data types including a numeric vector and show how to index the second position of that vector (through one statement)
5) Calculated the frequency of each character of the vector produced by: sample(letters, 10^5, replace = TRUE) and choosed an appropriate visualization in a figure.
6) Loading the iris data set and filtering out all instances with species setosa and sepal.length above 5.
7) Constructing a matrix consisting of two rows where the first one contains the 100 first (positive) integers in increasing order and the second row the 100 first (positive) integers in decreasing order and then use apply to sum the rows.
8) Construct a matrix and implement a nested for loop that runs through the matrix and doubles each element.
9) Implemented the previous solution but where the double for loop is replaced by nested sapply functions calls instead (i.e., no for loops).
10) Used outer to calculate all possible strings of length 2 using the set of characters {a, b, c}
11) Drawn 1000 points from the standard normal distribution and count the number of draws that are below −2.
12) Using the same data as in the previous exercise, obtained the indices of data points that are between −1 and 1. Ploted a histogram of these data points.
