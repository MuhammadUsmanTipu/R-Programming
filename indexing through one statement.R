#I construct a list with different data types i.e. character and numeric containing values. Then I do the indexong for the second element of numeric data type i.e.usman. [[]] is used to do indexing within a list.It will check usman and then gave us the second element of numeric vector in x and x is for printing  
 
 #Indexing within a list of different datatypes
 x<-list("datascience", usman=c(10,9,8,1,2,3)) [["usman"]] [2]
 #printing second element of numeric vector usman
 x
